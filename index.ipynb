In the last lesson, you were exposed to working with `surprise` datasets. In this lab, you will also go through the process of reading in a dataset into the `surprise` dataset format. To begin with, load the dataset into a Pandas DataFrame. Determine which columns are necessary for your recommendation system and drop any extraneous ones."
